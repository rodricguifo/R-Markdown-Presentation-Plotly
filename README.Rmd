Peer-graded Assignment: R Markdown Presentation & Plotly


## Instructions  ##

"Create a web page presentation using R Markdown that features a plot created with Plotly. Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities. Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a plot created with Plotly. We would love to see you show off your creativity!"

At the short time availability in the moment, I will design a presentation using R Markdown and Plotly very similar to the provided example.

### Structure ###

- a cover page with title, author name, and date
- graphic plotting
- end page with suitable contents, e.g. summary words, acknowledgements, references.
